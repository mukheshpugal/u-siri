# u/siri
A siri-like reddit chatbot (WIP). Feel free to fork and contribute.

## Setup
  1. Clone or download repo and extract
  2. Navigate to project folder via terminal
  3. Install necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  4. Run `python siri.py`.
  
**Note: pygame>=2.0.0.dev7 required for scrolling**

## To do
- [x] Display elements
- [x] Speech to text
- Make a framework for the actual chatbot
  - [ ] Prepare a dataset (preferably Reddit for an offensive one XD)
  - [ ] A model for the same (options - seq2seq with attention, BERT based)
  - [ ] Speech-based models for an actual Siri-experience (rather a better one lol)
- Text to speech
